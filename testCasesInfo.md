# INFORMATION ON TEST CASES

### Test cases are a lot like use cases.
### Actors, preconditions, and postconditions aren't required,
### although preconditions can be very helpful. 
### Most important difference is that in the dialog you use
### actual data instead of broad statements, including expected
### and actual outcome is important also. Basing test cases, later
### on, off of requirements will help you get "the most bang for the buck."

Build Team Notes

* If files are not showing up during commit creation with the command "git status", check _.gitignore_ for excluded files.

* ```git add .``` does not automatically include deleted files within the commit. Must use ```git add -u``` to commit deleted files/folders.

* We've had trouble with duplicate files, different cases... be careful. They can somehow corrupt git repositories...

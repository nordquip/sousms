INFORMATION ON TEST CASES
* Test cases are a lot like use cases.
* Actors, preconditions, and postconditions aren't required, although preconditions can be very helpful. 
* Most important difference is that in the dialog you use actual data instead of broad statements, including expected and actual outcome is important also. 
* Basing test cases, later on, off of requirements will help you get "the most bang for the buck."

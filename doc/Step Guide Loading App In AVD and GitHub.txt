###Step Guide to Android, the Android Virtual Device (AVD), and GitHub

1. Ensure your Eclipse workspace is _not_ the GitHub folder. Create projects in a different folder.
2. After you've created a project or downloaded the SOUSMS Mobile App code which the AVD can play go to File in Eclipse.
3. Click New --> Other
4. Click the Android folder --> Android Project from Existing Code
5. Import the folder containing all source code (from GitHub folder), it will automatically be copied to your workspace if it is not already there. If it's already in your workspace, delete it before importing it. You will need to do this every time you download the newest source code.
6. Once the files are imported simply scroll to src in the Java Project Navigation Pane, click a Java source file and run it using Eclipse.
7. The AVD will automatically install your file and load it. This may take a while, be patient.
8. Once you have tested the SOUSMS Mobile App to your satisfaction, simply copy the Apps entire library to C:\Users\YOUR_NAME_HERE\Documents\GitHub\SOUSMS-Mobile-Team\doc\Mobile App or its equivalent.

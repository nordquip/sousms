<br /><br />Energy or Royalty Trust<br /><br />
Investment vehicles that may engage in the development, acquisition, and/or production of oil and gas reserves. The trust receives royalty income from producing properties (essentially, net cash flow) and then sells interests in the trust (called trust units) to investors. Conventional oil and gas royalty trusts are actively managed portfolios holding assets of mature producing properties. Substantially all of the cash flow generated by the oil and gas assets, net of certain deductions, such as administrative expenses and management fees, is passed on to the unit holders as royalty income. Capital expenses may also be deducted, but are usually subject to restrictions on the amount. The distributions are highly dependent upon the cash flow generated by the trust. In general, the largest variable in determining the level of cash flow is the price of crude oil and natural gas.

Royalty trusts provide an alternative (from owning the shares of individual companies) for investors to participate in the oil and gas sector.

An exchange-traded, fixed income-like instrument consisting of a subordinated debt security and a share of common stock packaged together to form a tax-efficient delivery mechanism to distribute an issuer's free cash flow to its investors. Investors are paid dividends from the common share component and interest from the subordinated debt. The structure was created for U.S.-based companies to replicate the economic attributes of the Canadian income trust structure - providing steady, high-yield returns to U.S. and Canadian investors in U.S. companies. IDSs do not use the trust structure. Also known as income participating securities (IPS).

<br /><br />Income Stock<br /><br />
A security with a solid record of dividend payments and which offers a dividend yield higher than the average common stock.

<br /><br />Income Trust<br /><br />
Also called income funds. Income trusts are trusts structured to own debt and equity of an underlying entity, which carries on an active business, or has royalty revenues generated by the assets of an active business. By owning securities or assets of an underlying business, an income trust is structured to distribute cash flows, typically on a monthly basis, from those businesses to unit holders in a tax-efficient manner. The trust structure is typically utilized by mature, stable, sustainable, cash-generating businesses that require a limited amount of maintenance capital expenditures. An income trust is an exchange-traded equity investment that is similar to a common share.

There are four categories of income trusts: business trusts; real estate investment trusts (REITs); energy trusts; and power, pipeline, and utility trusts.

For example, if an issuer pays $0.04 quarterly, then the indicated rate is $0.04 X 4 or $0.16. In the case of issuers with no committed policy, the IAD is obtained by adding the dividend/distribution amounts paid in the last 12-month period. Indicated annual dividend/distribution is also referred to as indicated rate.

<br /><br />Indicative Calculated Closing Price (ICCP)<br /><br />
A feature of Market On Close (MOC), a TSX electronic call market facility, the Indicative Calculated Closing Price (ICCP) provides a preliminary indication of what the calculated closing price for a MOC security would be assuming the regular trading session had ended at the time of calculation. The ICCP is calculated without reference to volatility parameters. The ICCP for each MOC security will be broadcast to the trading community at 3:50 PM ET on each trading day, 10 minutes prior to the actual Market On Close execution. A key objective of broadcasting the ICCP is to provide market participants with an early indication of potentially large price movements at the close. The ICCP for all MOC securities will be included in the MOC Imbalance Report that is made available on tmxmoney.com.

Ten minutes before the close of the trading session, MOC publicly broadcasts an Indicative Calculated Closing Price (ICCP) that provides market participants with an indication of what the calculated closing price would be assuming the regular trading session had ended at that time (see Indicative Calculated Closing Price for more details). At the close, MOC matches orders, from the MOC and continuous market books, at a calculated closing price (which assures the most matches closest to the last sale price), and allocates the fills according to price and time priority.

<br /><br />Warrant<br /><br />
A security giving the holder the right to purchase securities at a stipulated price within a specified time limit. Exercise of the warrant is solely at the discretion of the holder. Warrants are not exercisable after the expiry date. A warrant is often issued in conjunction with another security as part of a financing. A warrant may be traded as a listed security or it may be held privately.

<br /><br />When-Issued Trading<br /><br />
Occurs when the security has been listed and posted for trading, but the certificate representing the security itself is not yet issued and available for settlement. The exchange bulletin issued on listing of the security indicates if the trading will be done on a when-issued basis. In this case, the issuance of the security is guaranteed and the delay in issuance is often due to factors relating to the printing and distribution of the security. The period for when-issued trading is usually less than one week.

<br /><br />Yield<br /><br />
This is the measure of the return on an investment and is shown as a percentage. A stock yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the stock's current market price. For example, a stock selling at $50 and with an annual dividend of $5 per share yields 10%. A bond yield is a more complicated calculation, involving annual interest payments, plus amortizing the difference between its current market price and par value over the life of the bond.<br /><br />
